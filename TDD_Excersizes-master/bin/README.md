# TDD_Excersizes

	This project contains the skeleton for a simple banking backend service and 
	Unit tests that will attempt to execute logic to verify it is working correctly.
	
	The goal of this exercise is to get the unit tests to pass by adding all the code
	necessary to complete this project.
	
	You may, and are encouraged to reorganize code and files as you see fit and add anything 
	to the project you feel will help complete this task, (I.e. 3rd party libraries, code files, etc.)
